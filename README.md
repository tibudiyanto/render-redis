# Redis on Render

This is an example repo with a Dockerfile for running a Redis cache with persistence as a **private service** on Render.

Render private services are only visible to other Render services in your account. They have internal URLs (e.g. `redis:6379`), can speak any protocol (like [RESP](https://redis.io/topics/protocol)), and can listen on any port.

Backing Redis with a disk makes it resilient to data loss in the case of restarts or deploys, and Render makes this easy to do with Render Disks.

### Deployment
1. Select **New Private Service** on your Render dashboard and use your fork of this repo to create the service.

2. Make sure the `Environment` is set to `Docker`, and enter a name for the service (this will be used to generate the private URL). 

3. Add a new disk in the `Advanced` section. Give it a name and set the mount path to `/var/lib/redis`. You can also change the default size for your disk: `1 GB` should be enough for small projects.

Click `Save` and you're good to go! Once deployed, your Redis instance will be available on a URL similar to `redis:10000`, and you can start using your Redis URL from other services in your Render account.
